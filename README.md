Online Retail Store System 

In this group project of size 4, we implemented an online retail store named 'ShopStop' fulfilling the daily households requirements.
The major focus is on the backend which deals with the database we created. We have made a normal frontend using Streamlit allowing customer 
to register, order items and employee to check inventory, register, deliver goods.

ER model is used to build the whole database project. First, different entities and their attributes are determined, and then the 
relationships is found and the relation is created as per the requirement. Different SQL queries were written covering all the real life 
operations required for an online store. Moreover, triggers are also used to handle some of the events as desired.

We enjoyed the project a lot, the learning experience was also very good.
